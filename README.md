# Ironhack-Final-Project

Members of the project: Maris Raudlam

### The goal of the project
This is a modelling project with the main goal of building a classification model about predicting the severeness of depression and anxiety. Also, a big part of the goal is to see which features used in the model are the most important ones. In addition, I will do some exploratory data analysis and visualizations to see into the data.

### Description of the data
Data is from kaggle.com. It has information about the scores of the depression, anxiety and stress scale (DASS), information about personality and demographic data.
It has about 39000 records. From DASS I will only use scores from depression and anxiety parts. The target variable will be final scores of depression and anxiety (which I will get by summing up the scores) and the categorization of the score (normal, mild, moderate, severe, extremely severe).
